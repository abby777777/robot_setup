# LeRobot Setup and Docker Run Instructions

Follow these steps to set up your system, clone and overlay LeRobot, and run the Docker container.

## 1. Set Up Udev Rules for USB Serial Devices

First, only connect the leader arm to the Jetson and record the serial ID by running:

ll /dev/serial/by-id/


Then, edit the first line of `./99-usb-serial.rules` as follows:

SUBSYSTEM=="tty", ATTRS{idVendor}=="2f5d", ATTRS{idProduct}=="2202", ATTRS{serial}=="BA98C8C350304A46462E3120FF121B06", SYMLINK+="ttyACM_kochleader" SUBSYSTEM=="tty", ATTRS{idVendor}=="2f5d", ATTRS{idProduct}=="2202", ATTRS{serial}=="00000000000000000000000000000000", SYMLINK+="ttyACM_kochfollower"

Copy the udev rules file and reboot:
sudo cp ./99-usb-serial.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/ sudo reboot


chmod +x clone_lerobot.sh
chmod +x overlay.sh

./clone_lerobot.sh
./overlay.sh

## 6. Testing and Calibration

### Check Video Device Streaming

To check video streaming, run:

ffplay /dev/video0

### Update Video Device Configuration

Edit the file `lerobot/lerobot/common/robot_devices/robots/config.py` and update the two instances where the word `logitech` appears to reflect your actual device values for `/dev/video0` and `/dev/video1`.

> **Note:** After updating the config, push the changes to GitHub so the Dockerfile will clone the new config file (disable cache if necessary).

### Run Calibration

To test calibration, run:

python lerobot/scripts/control_robot.py --robot.type=koch --control.type calibrate

If you need to mount files from your host, you can use the following volume mapping:

-v $(pwd)/data/lerobot/:/opt/lerobot/

You said:
ls -l /dev/ttyACM* i also want to check for video

The command you provided:

ls -l /dev/ttyACM*

lists all devices in /dev that match the pattern ttyACM*, which typically represent USB CDC ACM devices (often used for microcontrollers like Arduinos or similar USB devices).

To check for video devices, you can list them using a similar pattern. For example, you can run:

ls -l /dev/video*

This command lists all video device nodes (commonly /dev/video0, /dev/video1, etc.), which are usually created by your system when a webcam or other video capture device is connected.

For more detailed information about video devices, you can also use the Video4Linux (V4L2) tool if it’s installed:

v4l2-ctl --list-devices

This command provides a more descriptive output including the device names and their associated nodes.

Let me know if you need further details or help with these commands!

(base) abby@abby-F7BSC:~$  ok great does this look right

Yes, it looks correct. Your system has recognized two USB CDC ACM devices (ttyACM0 and ttyACM1) with their symbolic links correctly pointing to them, and you have multiple video devices detected (video0–video3) along with symbolic links that likely serve as more descriptive aliases for your webcam(s).

This indicates that both your serial and video devices are properly set up and recognized by your system.

    fi
fi explain to me what this does

This script is a Bash script designed to clone a GitHub repository into a specific target directory relative to where the script is located. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown:

    Determine the Script Directory:
        The script uses:

    SCRIPT_DIR="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" && pwd)"

    This command navigates to the directory containing the script and stores its absolute path in the variable SCRIPT_DIR.

Set the Relative Target Directory:

    It defines a path relative to the script's directory:

    RELATIVE_TARGET_DIR="$SCRIPT_DIR/../../../data"

    This means the target directory is located three levels up from the script’s directory, then inside a folder named data.

Resolve the Absolute Path:

    Using:

    TARGET_DIR="$(realpath "$RELATIVE_TARGET_DIR")"

    the script converts the relative target directory into an absolute path, ensuring it works regardless of the current working directory.

Define the Repository URL:

    The variable REPO_URL is set to:

    REPO_URL="https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot.git"

    which is the URL of the GitHub repository to be cloned.

Extract the Repository Name:

    The script extracts the repository name from the URL:

    REPO_NAME=$(basename -s .git "$REPO_URL")

    Here, basename -s .git removes the .git extension, so for the given URL, REPO_NAME becomes lerobot.

Determine the Clone Path:

    It builds the full path where the repository should be cloned:

    CLONE_PATH="$TARGET_DIR/$REPO_NAME"

Check if the Directory Already Exists:

    The script checks:

    if [ -d "$CLONE_PATH" ]; then
        echo "Directory $CLONE_PATH already exists. Skipping clone."
    else

    If the directory already exists, it prints a message and does not attempt to clone again.

Clone the Repository:

    If the directory does not exist, the script attempts to clone the repository:

git clone "$REPO_URL" "$CLONE_PATH"

After cloning, it verifies the success by checking if the directory now exists:

        if [ ! -d "$CLONE_PATH" ]; then
            echo "Error: Failed to clone repository to $CLONE_PATH"
            exit 1
        else
            echo "Repository cloned successfully to $CLONE_PATH."
        fi

Summary:
The script automates the process of cloning a specific GitHub repository (lerobot) into a target directory (located three levels up from the script's location, within a data directory). It first checks if the repository has already been cloned to avoid redundant operations, then proceeds with cloning and confirms the success of the operation.

# Copy the contents from the overlay directory to the target directory
echo "Copying files from $OVERLAY_DIR to $TARGET_DIR"
cp -r "$OVERLAY_DIR"/* "$TARGET_DIR"

echo "Files copied successfully!" what does this doe

This Bash script applies an "overlay" of files from one directory onto an existing target directory. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

    Determine the Script's Location:
    The script starts by figuring out its own directory using:

SCRIPT_DIR="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" && pwd)"

This ensures that subsequent paths are defined relative to where the script is located.

Define the Overlay Directory:
It sets the OVERLAY_DIR to be a folder named lerobot_overlay within the same directory as the script:

OVERLAY_DIR="$SCRIPT_DIR/lerobot_overlay"

Set the Target Directory:
The script constructs a relative path that goes three directories up from the script's location, then into data/lerobot:

RELATIVE_TARGET_DIR="$SCRIPT_DIR/../../../data/lerobot"

It then resolves this into an absolute path with:

TARGET_DIR="$(realpath "$RELATIVE_TARGET_DIR")"

Check for Directory Existence:

    It verifies if the overlay directory exists. If not, it prints an error and exits:

if [ ! -d "$OVERLAY_DIR" ]; then
    echo "Overlay directory $OVERLAY_DIR does not exist."
    exit 1
fi

It also checks if the target directory exists. If this directory is missing, it advises you to run another script (likely one that clones the repository into that location) before proceeding:

    if [ ! -d "$TARGET_DIR" ]; then
        echo "[Error] Target directory $TARGET_DIR does not exist."
        echo " "
        echo "Run 'clone_lerobot_dir_under_data.sh' first."
        exit 1
    fi

Copy Files from Overlay to Target:
If both directories exist, the script copies all files and subdirectories from the overlay directory to the target directory:

cp -r "$OVERLAY_DIR"/* "$TARGET_DIR"

This action overlays the content, effectively updating or adding files to the lerobot directory in the data folder.

Completion Message:
Finally, it prints a message confirming that the files have been copied successfully:

    echo "Files copied successfully!"

Summary:
The script is designed to update an existing lerobot repository (located in a specific data directory) by copying over additional or modified files from a local lerobot_overlay directory. This is useful when you need to apply patches, configuration changes, or supplemental content to an already set up repository.
You said:
why do i need to overlay and run that other script what do they do in combination

The two scripts work together to set up your project in two distinct steps:

    Clone the Base Repository:
    The first script (often named something like clone_lerobot_dir_under_data.sh) clones the official GitHub repository into a specific directory (e.g., data/lerobot). This ensures you have the original, unmodified project code from the source.

    Apply Local Customizations with the Overlay:
    The second script (the overlay script) then takes additional files or modifications from a local lerobot_overlay directory and copies them into the cloned repository. This “overlays” your custom changes on top of the base repository.

Why Use Both?

    Separation of Concerns:
    Cloning keeps the original repository intact, while the overlay applies your custom changes separately. This makes it easier to update the base repository in the future without losing your local modifications.

    Ease of Updates:
    If the base repository is updated, you can re-run the clone script to refresh the original code and then apply your overlay again to bring in your customizations.

    Modularity:
    It separates the process of fetching the upstream code from the process of applying local tweaks, which can simplify debugging and maintenance.

In combination, they let you manage both the official code and your custom modifications in a structured way.

CMD ["/bin/bash", "-c", "/ryzers/test.sh && exec /bin/bash"] does it make sense to only run overlay.sh one after cloning here in the docker -- will that correctly set this up

Yes, it makes sense to run your overlay script immediately after cloning in the Dockerfile if your goal is to apply your custom modifications on top of the base repository. Here's how they work together:

    Cloning the Repository:
    The Dockerfile clones the official LeRobot repository and installs its dependencies. This gives you the verified, upstream code.

    Applying the Overlay:
    An overlay script is typically used to inject local customizations (patches, configuration changes, extra files, etc.) into the cloned repository. Running overlay.sh right after cloning means you’re immediately applying your custom changes to the base code before any further steps or usage.

For this to work correctly in your Docker build, make sure that:

    The Overlay Script and Its Files Are Included:
    Ensure the overlay script (and any files it needs) are part of the Docker build context (using COPY or ADD) so that they are available in the container.

    The Paths Are Correct:
    The overlay script should reference the correct directories within the container. For example, if it expects the LeRobot repo to be in /ryzers/lerobot, that’s where it should copy files to.

    Order of Operations:
    The overlay script should run after cloning and before any steps that depend on the modified code. This ensures the final image includes your custom changes.

So, if overlay.sh is designed to copy or modify files within the cloned repository, running it right after the clone step will correctly set up your Docker container with both the base LeRobot code and your custom modifications.

How This Works in Combination

    Cloning and Installation:
    The repository is cloned into /ryzers/lerobot and its dependencies are installed.

    Overlay Application:
    The overlay.sh script (copied into /ryzers) looks for its companion directory lerobot_overlay (located alongside it) and attempts to copy its contents to a target directory defined as three levels up from /ryzers into data/lerobot.
        If your intended target is the cloned LeRobot repository, make sure either to adjust the overlay script’s target path (for example, to /ryzers/lerobot) or set up your directory structure so that the repository is indeed under /data/lerobot.
        Running the overlay script immediately after cloning applies your custom modifications on top of the base repository.

    Final Setup:
    The container then copies test.sh, makes it executable, and uses it as part of the container’s start-up command.

This setup allows you to manage the base repository and your custom overlay separately, and then merge them in the final image.

  ryzerdocker add priveleged

Adding the --privileged flag to your Docker run command grants the container extended privileges. It gives the container almost full access to the host system's devices and capabilities, which can be necessary for certain hardware interactions or debugging tasks, but it also reduces the isolation between the container and the host.

For example, your updated Docker run command would look like this:

docker run -it --rm --shm-size=16G \
  --privileged \
  --cap-add=SYS_PTRACE \
  --network=host \
  --ipc=host \

  --group-add video \
  --group-add render \
  -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY \
  -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix \
  ryzerdocker

What Does the --privileged Flag Do?

    Expanded Access: It allows the container to perform actions and access devices that normally require elevated privileges. This can be particularly useful when you need the container to interact with hardware (like GPUs, cameras, or other devices) or perform system-level operations.
    Security Considerations: Because the container gains extensive control over the host, using --privileged can expose the host to potential security risks. It's best to use it only when absolutely necessary and ideally in a controlled environment.

In your use case, if your application or testing requires direct and extensive access to host devices (beyond what is already provided by specific --device flags and capabilities), adding --privileged might be necessary. Just be mindful of the security implications, especially if the container is run in a less controlled or production environment.

root@abby-F7BSC:/ryzers# ffplay /dev/video0
bash: ffplay: command not found

The error indicates that ffplay isn’t installed on your system. ffplay is a media player that comes with the FFmpeg suite.
How to Resolve

    Install FFmpeg (which includes ffplay):

    If you're on Ubuntu or a similar Debian-based system, you can install it with:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install ffmpeg

Verify Installation:

After installation, run:

ffplay -version

to confirm that ffplay is now available.

Using ffplay:

Once installed, you should be able to run your command:

    ffplay /dev/video0

    to view the video stream.

In a Docker Container

If you need ffplay in your Docker container, you should add the installation commands to your Dockerfile. For example:

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y ffmpeg

This ensures that ffplay will be available when the container is built.

list video devices present

To list the video devices available on your system, you can use the following command:

ls -l /dev/video*

This will display all devices whose names start with /dev/video (e.g., /dev/video0, /dev/video1, etc.), along with their details.

Alternatively, if you have the Video4Linux2 control utility installed, you can get more detailed information by running:

v4l2-ctl --list-devices

This command shows each video device along with its associated device nodes and additional information.

Both methods help you confirm which video devices are currently present and accessible.

Could not initialize SDL - No available video device
(Did you set the DISPLAY variable?) why does it matter that display is set?

The DISPLAY variable tells graphical applications (like those using SDL) which display server to use for rendering. In an X Window System, the DISPLAY environment variable specifies the display (and optionally the screen) where the application should open its window. If it's not set (or set incorrectly), SDL won't know where to send its graphical output, so it fails to initialize the video device.

For example, if you're running on a desktop with an X server, setting DISPLAY to something like :0 or :0.0 ensures that applications know to use your active display. Without it, you'll see errors like "Could not initialize SDL - No available video device" because the application doesn't have a target display.

    Ensure that when you run your container (or application) you pass the DISPLAY variable. For Docker, this typically means adding:

    -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix

    to your docker run command.

2. Authorization Required, but No Authorization Protocol Specified

    Why it happens:
    Even if DISPLAY is set, the X server enforces access control. If the container (or application) doesn’t have permission to connect to the host’s X server, you get an authorization error.
    How to fix:
    Use the xhost command on your host to allow local connections. For example:

    xhost +local:

    This temporarily relaxes access control to allow applications from your local machine (or container) to access the display. Be cautious with this in a less-secure environment.

3. XDG_RUNTIME_DIR Not Set

    Why it matters:
    XDG_RUNTIME_DIR is used by various applications to store runtime data (like authentication tokens). If it’s not set, some libraries might fail to initialize properly.
    How to fix:
    You can set this variable in your environment. For example, in your shell or Dockerfile, add:

export XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/tmp/runtime-dir
mkdir -p /tmp/runtime-dir
chmod 700 /tmp/runtime-dir

Or, add it as an environment variable in your Docker run command:

    -e XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/tmp/runtime-dir

    Make sure that the directory exists and has the appropriate permissions.

Summary

    Set the DISPLAY variable and mount the X11 socket so your container/application can connect to your X server.
    Allow X server access using xhost +local:.
    Set XDG_RUNTIME_DIR to a valid directory with the correct permissions.

These steps should help SDL initialize a video device by giving it the proper display and runtime environment.
You said:
xhost +local: can i add this to my docker?

You can, but it's generally not recommended to run it directly inside the container. The xhost +local: command is meant to be run on the host to allow local (including container) connections to your X server. Typically, you would run this command on your host machine before starting the container.

For example, you can run on your host terminal:

xhost +local:

Then, launch your container with the appropriate -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY and volume mount for /tmp/.X11-unix.

If you really want to automate it as part of your container launch process, you could wrap the container startup in a shell script on the host that first runs xhost +local: and then starts the container. However, embedding it in the Dockerfile isn’t effective because the Dockerfile builds the container image, and xhost needs to modify settings on the host's X server, not inside the container.

ffplay isn’t a Python package, so it can’t be installed using pip. Instead, it's a command-line tool that comes bundled with the FFmpeg suite. To install ffplay, you need to install FFmpeg using your system’s package manager. For example, on Ubuntu you can run:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install ffmpeg

After installation, running ffplay -version should confirm that it's installed.

The error indicates that the code is trying to open a serial port at /dev/ttyACM_kochfollower, but that device file isn’t available in your environment. Here are some steps and explanations to help you troubleshoot and resolve the issue:
1. Confirm the Device Exists on the Host

    Check on the Host:
    Run:

ls -l /dev/ttyACM*

Ensure that /dev/ttyACM_kochfollower (or its underlying device, like /dev/ttyACM1) exists on your host system.
Symlink Creation:
If you see something like:

    /dev/ttyACM0
    /dev/ttyACM1
    lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 7 Mar  3 13:30 /dev/ttyACM_kochfollower -> ttyACM1

    then the symlink exists. If not, you may need to create it manually or adjust your configuration to match the available device.

2. Docker Container Device Mapping

    Ensure Devices Are Mapped:
    When running your Docker container, you need to map the host’s device into the container. In your Docker run command, you’re using:

    --device=/dev/ttyACM_kochfollower:/dev/ttyACM_kochfollower

    Make sure that this mapping corresponds to a valid device on the host. If the host device is named differently (for example, /dev/ttyACM1), either update the mapping or create the necessary symlink on the host.

3. Permissions and Privileges

    Permissions:
    Ensure that the container (or the user running the script) has sufficient permissions to access the device. Running the container with --privileged or ensuring the correct group memberships might be required.
    Group Membership:
    Sometimes adding the container user to the appropriate group (like dialout) is necessary for serial devices.

4. Adjusting the Configuration

    Configuration Files:
    If your application (LeRobot in this case) is configured to look for /dev/ttyACM_kochfollower, verify whether that’s the correct expected device name. You might need to update the configuration if the device file on your host is named differently.
    Create a Symlink Manually:
    On the host, you can create the missing symlink if the underlying device exists:

    sudo ln -s /dev/ttyACM1 /dev/ttyACM_kochfollower

    Then, rerun the container ensuring the device mapping passes the correct file.

Summary

The error is caused by the application trying to open a serial port that isn’t present. You need to:

    Verify that /dev/ttyACM_kochfollower (or its target) exists on the host.
    Ensure your Docker run command maps the correct device into the container.
    Adjust configuration or create symlinks as necessary.
    Check permissions to allow the container access to the serial device.

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the error and allow your application to access the intended serial port.

why doesnt the kockfollower and kockleader show up

If the symlinks for your devices aren’t being created, it’s likely that the udev rules aren’t matching the devices as expected. Here are some things to check:
1. Verify Device Attributes

Use the udevadm tool to inspect the device attributes. For example, run:

udevadm info -a -n /dev/ttyACM0

Look for the serial attribute in the output. The rule must match the exact value provided by the device. It’s possible that:

    The serial numbers are different than what you have in your rules.
    The device might expose the serial attribute in a parent device, so you may need to adjust the rule (for instance, using a different level of attribute match).

2. Rule Syntax and Placement

    Make sure your rules file is in the correct directory (e.g., /etc/udev/rules.d/) with a .rules extension.
    After saving or modifying rules, reload udev with:

    sudo udevadm control --reload
    sudo udevadm trigger

    Unplug and replug the device to ensure the new rule is applied.

3. Check for Typos and Completeness

For the ttyACM_kochleader rule, ensure that the serial number "58FD016389" exactly matches the device's attribute. Sometimes devices may have longer serial numbers or different formatting.
4. Debugging

If you’re still not seeing the symlinks:

    Temporarily simplify the rule to see if any match occurs. For example, remove the serial condition to see if a symlink gets created:

    SUBSYSTEM=="tty", KERNEL=="ttyACM*", SYMLINK+="ttyACM_debug"

    Then re-run udevadm trigger and check if /dev/ttyACM_debug appears.

By verifying the device attributes and ensuring the rules are loaded correctly, you can adjust your rules so that the symlinks (ttyACM_kochfollower and ttyACM_kochleader) are properly created.

root@abby-F7BSC:/ryzers# ls /dev/ttyACM*
/dev/ttyACM0  /dev/ttyACM1
root@abby-F7BSC:/ryzers#  its not symlinking or how can i check it it is

When you run:

ls -l /dev/ttyACM*

you should see output like this if the symlinks are in place:

crw-rw---- 1 root dialout ... /dev/ttyACM0
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root      ... /dev/ttyACM_kochfollower -> ttyACM1

The arrow (->) indicates a symlink. In your output, you only see /dev/ttyACM0 and /dev/ttyACM1, which means the symlinks (like /dev/ttyACM_kochfollower and /dev/ttyACM_kochleader) are not present.
How to Check and Troubleshoot

    Verify on the Host:
    Since udev rules are processed on the host, make sure to run the command on your host system rather than inside the Docker container (unless you explicitly passed the udev-managed device nodes into the container).

    Inspect Device Attributes:
    Use udevadm to check if the device attributes match your udev rule conditions. For example:

sudo udevadm info -a -n /dev/ttyACM0

Look for the serial attribute. Confirm that it exactly matches the value specified in your rule for ttyACM_kochfollower (and similarly for the leader).

Reload udev Rules:
If you’ve recently added or modified your udev rules, reload them and trigger the rules:

sudo udevadm control --reload
sudo udevadm trigger

Then, unplug and replug the device to force the rules to apply.

Check Rule File Location:
Make sure your udev rules file is placed in the correct directory (commonly /etc/udev/rules.d/) and has a .rules extension.

Simplify the Rule for Debugging:
To see if any rule is applied, you can temporarily write a simpler rule such as:

SUBSYSTEM=="tty", KERNEL=="ttyACM*", SYMLINK+="ttyACM_debug"

After reloading udev rules and reconnecting your device, run:

    ls -l /dev/ttyACM_debug

    If that appears, it indicates that the udev subsystem is working and the issue might be with the specific attribute matches in your original rules.

By following these steps, you can verify if the symlinks are being created on the host. Once confirmed, ensure that your Docker run command maps those device nodes (including the symlinks) into the container correctly.
You said:
/dev/ttyACM0  /dev/ttyACM1
root@abby-F7BSC:/ryzers# ls -l /dev/ttyACM*
crw-rw---- 1 root dialout 166, 0 Mar  4 21:04 /dev/ttyACM0
crw-rw---- 1 root dialout 166, 1 Mar  4 21:04 /dev/ttyACM1
root@abby-F7BSC:/ryzers#  they are not present

Since you don't see the expected symlinks (like /dev/ttyACM_kochfollower or /dev/ttyACM_kochleader), it indicates that the udev rules you wrote are not matching or not being applied. Here are some steps to troubleshoot and fix the issue:
1. Check the udev Rules File

    Location:
    Make sure your rules file is placed in the correct directory, for example:

/etc/udev/rules.d/99-my-serial.rules

The file must have a .rules extension.

Content Verification:
Confirm that the contents exactly match what you expect. For example:

    SUBSYSTEM=="tty", ATTRS{serial}=="ED8061EB503059384C2E3120FF09021F", SYMLINK+="ttyACM_kochfollower"
    SUBSYSTEM=="tty", ATTRS{serial}=="58FD016389", SYMLINK+="ttyACM_kochleader"

2. Verify Device Attributes

    Use udevadm:
    Run the following command to inspect the attributes of your device:

    sudo udevadm info -a -n /dev/ttyACM0

    Look for the serial attribute in the output. Make sure it exactly matches the string you provided in the rule for ttyACM_kochfollower (or adjust the rule if it differs).

3. Reload and Trigger udev

    Reload Rules:
    After editing or adding the rules file, reload the udev rules with:

sudo udevadm control --reload

Trigger the Rules:
Then force udev to re-process existing devices:

    sudo udevadm trigger

    Reconnect Devices:
    Sometimes it helps to unplug and replug the device so the new rules are applied.

4. Debugging with a Simple Rule

    Test a Generic Rule:
    Create a temporary rule to see if any symlink is created. For example:

SUBSYSTEM=="tty", KERNEL=="ttyACM*", SYMLINK+="ttyACM_debug"

Save it (e.g., in /etc/udev/rules.d/99-debug.rules), reload the rules, and then check if /dev/ttyACM_debug appears:

    ls -l /dev/ttyACM_debug

    If this works, then udev is processing your files, and the issue is likely with the specific attribute matches in your original rules.

5. Adjust the Rules if Needed

    Attribute Location:
    Sometimes the serial attribute may not be available directly on the tty device node but rather on a parent node. In that case, you might need to adjust your rule to match a parent attribute. The output from udevadm info -a -n /dev/ttyACM0 will show a hierarchy of devices—check which level contains the correct serial attribute.

Summary

    Ensure the rules file is in the right location and has the correct content.
    Reload and trigger udev so the rules are applied.
    Use udevadm to verify that the attribute values match your rules.
    Test with a generic rule to verify that udev is processing your rules.

Once these steps are correctly performed, the expected symlinks should appear (e.g., /dev/ttyACM_kochfollower and /dev/ttyACM_kochleader), and then your Docker container can map those symlinked device nodes as intended.

they exist only outside of the docker for some reason even though they are passed in

When you pass a device mapping with Docker (using the --device flag), Docker resolves the device file on the host and mounts the underlying device into the container. This means that even though your host has symlinks (like /dev/ttyACM_kochleader and /dev/ttyACM_kochfollower), Docker is mounting the actual device files (e.g., /dev/ttyACM0 and /dev/ttyACM1) instead of preserving the symlink names.
Why the Symlinks Aren't Visible Inside Docker

    Symlink Resolution:
    Docker’s device-mapping mechanism follows the symlink on the host and mounts the actual device file at the specified container path. This results in the mounted file showing up as the underlying device rather than as a symlink.

    Explicit Mapping:
    Even though you passed the symlink paths (e.g., --device=/dev/ttyACM_kochleader:/dev/ttyACM_kochleader), Docker resolves these to the target device files. As a result, inside the container, you'll see the actual device files (like /dev/ttyACM0 or /dev/ttyACM1), not the symlink names.

How to Get the Symlinks Inside the Container

If your application relies on the specific symlink names, you have a couple of options:

    Manually Create the Symlinks in the Container:
    You can add commands to your Dockerfile or an entrypoint script to create the symlinks after the container starts. For example, if you know which device corresponds to which symlink, add something like:

    RUN ln -s /dev/ttyACM1 /dev/ttyACM_kochfollower && \
        ln -s /dev/ttyACM0 /dev/ttyACM_kochleader

    Adjust the target paths as needed.

    Mount the Underlying Device and Use Your Configuration:
    If your application can be configured to use /dev/ttyACM0 and /dev/ttyACM1 directly, then you may not need the symlinks at all. Update your application configuration to reference the device files that are actually present inside the container.

Summary

    Docker resolves symlinks in device mappings, so inside the container you'll only see the actual device files.
    If your application requires the symlink names, create those symlinks manually inside the container using a Dockerfile command or an entrypoint script.
    Alternatively, adjust your application configuration to use the actual device file names.

These approaches should help you achieve the desired setup inside your Docker container.

LeRobot Setup and Docker Run Instructions

Follow these steps to set up your system, clone and overlay LeRobot, and run the Docker container.
1. Set Up Udev Rules for USB Serial Devices

First, only connect the leader arm to the Jetson and record the serial ID by running:

ll /dev/serial/by-id/

Then, edit the first line of ./99-usb-serial.rules as follows:

SUBSYSTEM=="tty", ATTRS{idVendor}=="2f5d", ATTRS{idProduct}=="2202", ATTRS{serial}=="BA98C8C350304A46462E3120FF121B06", SYMLINK+="ttyACM_kochleader"

Copy the udev rules file and reboot:

sudo cp ./99-usb-serial.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/
sudo reboot

2. Make Scripts Executable

Make sure your cloning and overlay scripts are executable:

chmod +x clone_lerobot.sh
chmod +x overlay.sh

Then run them:

./clone_lerobot.sh
./overlay.sh

3. Prepare the Docker Base Image

Pull the verified ROCm PyTorch image:

docker pull rocm/pytorch:rocm6.3.3_ubuntu22.04_py3.10_pytorch_release_2.4.0

4. Set Up X11 Access

Allow local connections to the X server:

xhost +local:

5. Build and Run the Docker Container
Build the Docker Image

docker build -t ryzerdocker .

Run the Docker Container

sudo docker run -it --rm --shm-size=16G \

6. Testing and Calibration
Check Video Device Streaming

To check for video numbers and stream from /dev/video0, run:

ffplay /dev/video0

Update Video Device Configuration

Edit the file lerobot/lerobot/common/robot_devices/robots/config.py and change the two places where the word logitech appears to match your values for /dev/video0 and /dev/video1.
Note: After making these changes, push the updated config file to GitHub so that the Dockerfile clone pulls the new version (disable cache if needed).
Run Calibration

To try calibration, execute:

python lerobot/scripts/control_robot.py --robot.type=koch --control.type calibrate

7. Optional: Mounting Data Directory

If you need to mount files, you can use the following volume mapping (if required):

-v $(pwd)/data/lerobot/:/opt/lerobot/

Leave this as-is if not needed.

This README should now be easy to follow and provides all necessary steps to get your system running with LeRobot and Docker.

# LeRobot Setup and Docker Run Instructions

Follow these steps to set up your system, clone and overlay LeRobot, and run the Docker container.

---

## 1. Set Up Udev Rules for USB Serial Devices

First, only connect the leader arm to the Jetson and record the serial ID by running:

```bash
ll /dev/serial/by-id/

Then, edit the first line of ./99-usb-serial.rules as follows:

SUBSYSTEM=="tty", ATTRS{idVendor}=="2f5d", ATTRS{idProduct}=="2202", ATTRS{serial}=="BA98C8C350304A46462E3120FF121B06", SYMLINK+="ttyACM_kochleader"
SUBSYSTEM=="tty", ATTRS{idVendor}=="2f5d", ATTRS{idProduct}=="2202", ATTRS{serial}=="00000000000000000000000000000000", SYMLINK+="ttyACM_kochfollower"

Copy the udev rules file and reboot:

sudo cp ./99-usb-serial.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/
sudo reboot

2. Make Scripts Executable and Run Them

Make sure your cloning and overlay scripts are executable:

chmod +x clone_lerobot.sh
chmod +x overlay.sh

Then run the scripts:

./clone_lerobot.sh
./overlay.sh

3. Prepare the Docker Base Image

Pull the verified ROCm PyTorch image:

docker pull rocm/pytorch:rocm6.3.3_ubuntu22.04_py3.10_pytorch_release_2.4.0

4. Set Up X11 Access

Allow local connections to the X server:

xhost +local:

5. Build and Run the Docker Container
Build the Docker Image

docker build -t ryzerdocker .

Run the Docker Container

sudo docker run -it --rm --shm-size=16G \
  --privileged \
  --cap-add=SYS_PTRACE \
  --network=host \
  --ipc=host \
  -e HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION=11.0.0 \
  --device=/dev/kfd \
  --device=/dev/dri \
  --device=/dev/ttyACM_kochleader:/dev/ttyACM_kochleader \
  --device=/dev/ttyACM_kochfollower:/dev/ttyACM_kochfollower \
  --device=/dev/video0:/dev/video0 \
  --device=/dev/video2:/dev/video2 \
  --security-opt seccomp=unconfined \
  --group-add video \
  --group-add render \
  -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY \
  -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix \
  ryzerdocker

6. Testing and Calibration
Check Video Device Streaming

To check video streaming, run:

ffplay /dev/video0

Update Video Device Configuration

Edit the file lerobot/lerobot/common/robot_devices/robots/config.py and update the two instances where the word logitech appears to reflect your actual device values for /dev/video0 and /dev/video1.

Note: After updating the config, push the changes to GitHub so the Dockerfile will clone the new config file (disable cache if necessary).
Run Calibration

To test calibration, run:

python lerobot/scripts/control_robot.py --robot.type=koch --control.type calibrate

7. Optional: Mounting Data Directory

If you need to mount files from your host, you can use the following volume mapping:

-v $(pwd)/data/lerobot/:/opt/lerobot/

Leave this as-is if you do not need to mount additional files.

This README provides a complete guide to set up LeRobot with Docker. If you encounter issues with device symlinks inside Docker, consider creating the symlinks manually in the container or adjusting your application configuration to use the actual device files.


Simply copy the above content into a file named `README.md` in your project directory.
